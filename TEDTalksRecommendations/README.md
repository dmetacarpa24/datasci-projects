## YS DM Final Project - COSC 112 Section 2
### Title: TED Talks Recommendations
### Authors: Erko Sakhiyeva, David Metacarpa
### Last Updated: May 9, 2022

### Project description: 
An app that creates recommendations for TED Talks that a user may be interested in. 
First, the user inputs keywords related to a topic theyâ€™re interested in. 
The app then searches for those keywords in the tags of a database of recent TED Talks since 2016. 
Finally, the app displays up to five of the most relevant Talks according to those keywords, 
ordering them by likeability ratio (likes over views), to hopefully maximize user enjoyment.
The app asks if the user would like to see more recommendations, if they are available.

### Used
1. R to wrangle dataset and scrape for topics from TED talk websites.
Original dataset data.csv, transformed into dataset we use for the project datated.csv.
2. Java to make the program and create a list of topics for the user to choose from.

### Files Needed
1. datated.csv (created from data.csv and wrangling.R)
2. app.java
