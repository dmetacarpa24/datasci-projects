I completed this blog in Amherst College's Data Science class (STAT 231) with two of my classmates.  I was responsible for completing the last two tabs of the blog, entitled "Algae Cover" and "Nutrient Levels".  The goal of these two tabs is to look for linear relationships between Fauna Diversity, Nutrient Content in Sediment, and Algal Cover on each of the Galician beaches studied.
